Regarding the estimates: I can finish the code without using too much time.
I have more accuracy when I start working on a new prac.

Regarding code reviews: At the beginning, it took more time to read and understand other's code.
However, it improved my skills so I can read code more carefully in a short time.

Regarding practical tasks: I may make the instruction more clear and provide sample.
